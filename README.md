# Yujin Kim's Personal Website

This is my personal academic website, built from the [PRISM](https://github.com/xyjoey/PRISM) template by [Jiale Liu (Joey)](https://github.com/xyjoey), licensed under MIT.

## ✨ Features

*   **📄 Configuration-Driven**: Manage your entire site's content using simple `TOML`, `Markdown`, and `BibTeX` files in the `content/` directory. No code changes required for content updates!
*   **📚 BibTeX Support**: Directly render your publications from a `.bib` file. Includes search, filtering (Year, Type), and automatic citation generation.
*   **🎨 Modern Design**: Clean, responsive UI with a beautiful serif/sans-serif typography pairing, smooth animations (Framer Motion), and Dark Mode support.
*   **⚡️ High Performance**: Built on Next.js 20 with Turbopack. Static export ensures blazing fast load times and easy deployment.
*   **🔍 SEO Optimized**: Dynamic metadata generation for every page.
*   **🧩 Dynamic Routing**: Easily add new pages by simply creating a config file.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js 22 or later
    *   **Important**: Please download and install Node.js manually from [https://nodejs.org/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download).
    *   Better not to use the pre-installed version on your system, as it may be outdated or incompatible.
*   npm, pnpm, or yarn

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/eidus/eidus.github.io.git
    cd eidus.github.io
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## 🛠️ Configuration

All content lives in the `content/` directory.

### 1. Global Site Config (`content/config.toml`)
Configure your site title, author details, social links, and navigation menu here.

```toml
[site]
title = "Your Name"
description = "Personal website of Your Name"
url = "https://your-website.com"

[author]
name = "Your Name"
title = "PhD Student / Researcher"
# ...

[features]
enable_likes = true
```

### 2. Homepage (`content/about.toml`)
Customize the "About" section, "News", and "Selected Publications" on the homepage.

### 3. Publications (`content/publications.bib`)
Export your publications from Google Scholar, Zotero, or Mendeley to `content/publications.bib`. PRISM automatically parses this file to generate your Publications page. Customize the display of publications by changing `selected`, `preview` and `description` keys in the bib file. 

Publication titles support a subset of BibTeX inline formatting commands, including `\textit{}`, `\emph{}`, `\textbf{}`, `\textsc{}`, `\textsuperscript{}` and `\textsubscript{}`.

### 4. Adding New Pages
To add a new page (e.g., "Projects"), create a TOML file in `content/` (e.g., `content/projects.toml`) and add it to the `navigation` list in `content/config.toml`.

Supported page types:
*   `text`: Renders Markdown content (Great for CVs, Bio).
*   `card`: Renders a list of cards (Great for Projects, Awards). Content of each card item supports Markdown.
*   `publication`: Renders the full publications list with filters.

### 5. I18N Support (`content_<locale>/`)
PRISM now supports i18n, i.e., multi-language.

*   Default language lives in `content/`.
*   Additional languages live in `content_<locale>/` (for example: `content_ko/`, `content_en/`).
*   Keep the same filenames across directories. Example:
    *   `content/cv.md` (default)
    *   `content_ko/cv.md`
*   If a localized file is missing, PRISM automatically falls back to the default `content/` version.

Configure language behavior in `content/config.toml`:

## 📦 Deployment

PRISM is optimized for static deployment.

```bash
npm run build
```

This generates a static `out/` directory that can be hosted anywhere.
